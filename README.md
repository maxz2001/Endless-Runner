*************************************

Thank you for checking out my Unity game!

The game is fairly simple- up arrow key to move the bird upwards, down arrow key to move the bird downwards.

One point is collected for every fox that is avoided- the game is infinite, so collect as many points as possible and beat your high score!

*************************************

The game's logic is written in C# scripts, which can be found in the 'Endless Runner Code + Assets' --> 'Endless Runner' --> 'Assets' --> 'Scripts' folder.
